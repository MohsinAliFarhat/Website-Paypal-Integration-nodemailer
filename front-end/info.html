If you choose to immigrate to Canada as a provincial nominee, you must first apply to the province where you wish to settle and complete its provincial nomination process. The province will consider your application based on its immigration needs and your genuine intention to settle there. As of January 2015, most of the provincial nominee programs have combined their programs with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cicsimmigration.com/canadian-immigration-information/express-entry/">Express Entry</a>&nbsp;system and will now accept a portion of their applicants through that program. Here is a list of the provinces and territories currently participating in this program. Since the criteria vary among the provinces, you should visit their websites for more information.<br></p>

                            <p>After you have been nominated by a province or territory, you have to make a separate application to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) for permanent residence. A&nbsp;CIC&nbsp;officer will then assess your application based on Canadian immigration regulations. You will have to pass a medical examination and security and criminal checks. You must also show that you have enough money to support yourself and your dependents after you arrive in Canada. You can find more information on the funds you will need in the Related Links section at the bottom of this page.

                            <p>Preparing file for submission to Canada Immigration<br></p>
                            <p>In most instances, a work permit will only be issued by an immigration officer after Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) has approved the job offer of a Canadian employer to a foreign national. An HRDC opinion enables Immigration Canada to determine whether the employment of the foreign worker is likely to have a positive, neutral or negative impact on the labor market in Canada. A positive or neutral labor market opinion is necessary for a foreign worker to be issued a work permit. The factors HRDC considers include whether a Canadian or immigrant could fill the job; whether the hiring of a foreign national will help create opportunities or benefit for Canadian job seekers; and whether working conditions and wages offered are in line with what a Canadian would expect. The HRD validation process thus entails that the Canadian employer demonstrate that a "significant" effort has been made to seek and hire a Canadian for the position in which there is a petition for validation. Work permit will be refused if the HRDC opinion is that the wages and working conditions offered are insufficient to attract and retain Canadian job-seekers. This policy is to ensure that foreign workers are not improperly used by Canadian employers to drive down the wage structure in the Canadian labor market. Once HRDC grants a confirmation for the job that the foreign worker has been offered, the worker may apply for a work permit at a visa office, or, if the worker is a U.S. citizen, at a port of entry.<br><br></p>

                                Due to the high number of interest, most business programs have a limited number of applicants that are accepted.
                                <br>
                                <strong>Here are just some of the ways:</strong>

                                <br>
                                This is one of the oldest and most popular investor program around. It is essentially a passive investment program where the individual must have at least $2,000,000 CAD in assets and be able to invest into the province of Quebec.
                                <br>
                                <strong>Provincial  Immigration Entrepreneur  Programs</strong>
                                Other provincial programs are active business programs. They all have similarities and differences. Some of the programs require a deposit before the individual is accepted and some require proof of business activity.
                                <br>
                                <strong>Business Start-up through the intra-company transferee program</strong>
                                If you have an active company in a country that belongs to the World Trade Organization and wish to open a branch/subsidiary/affiliate in Canada, this could be a path towards becoming a Canadian Permanent Resident.
